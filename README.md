# Machine-Learning-Assistant
ML Vision Assistant is an intuitive graphical interface that simplifies the machine learning workflow while providing powerful visualization capabilities. The application now features a comprehensive 2D visualization tool that enables users to explore relationships between features, understand data distributions, and visualize model decision boundaries.

Key Features Added:
Interactive 2D Visualization:

Visualize any two features from your dataset

Color points by target variable (classification or regression)

Differentiate training and test data with distinct markers

Plot decision boundaries for classification models

Customizable display options

Enhanced Data Exploration:

Intuitive feature selection interface

Dynamic coloring based on target values

Clear differentiation between train/test splits

Visual representation of model decision regions

User-Friendly Workflow:

Simple dialog-based parameter selection

Automatic handling of categorical coloring

Continuous color mapping for regression problems

Integrated with existing ML pipeline

How to Use the 2D Visualization:
Load your dataset and split into train/test sets

Navigate to the Results tab

Click the "2D Visualization" button

Select features for X and Y axes

Choose coloring and split display options

Click "Generate Plot" to visualize your data

The visualization helps you:

Identify feature relationships and correlations

Understand class separation in classification problems

Visualize decision boundaries of trained models

Evaluate train/test distribution patterns

Detect outliers and data clusters
